          The tech industry always offers us new challenging paths to explore,
          and that's what I love about it. I am currently specialized in web
          applications, data extraction and data flows management, but I am
          really curious about development in general. I enjoy thinking about
          the best and simple way to bring my ideas to the final customers, and
          always try to push the projects further within a passionate team.
